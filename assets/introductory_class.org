* Introduction
** Who am I

- I hold a PhD in Economics from Columbia University
- Currently work at Graham Capital Management as a Portfolio Analyst


** Who are you?
- Interest in:
  1. Academia?
  2. Private sector jobs? Of what kind?
  3. Policy job?
     
* Structure of the course

** Roadmap 
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_opt: allowframebreaks
:END:

  1. Groups are formed -- *deadline: next week (Jan 28)*
     + if there are ungroupped people by week 3, I will act as central planner
  2. Pick a few interesting topics you may be interested in writing about
     + I have listed a few here
  3. Study the literature on chosen topics and *present to the class* 
  4. Decide on your own project:
     + usually an incremental research question starting from the presented papers, replication or methodological tweak
     + *weeks 2 - 7*, in parallel with topic presentations
  5. Deliver project plan
     + a concrete, actionable plan that can be executed in 7 weeks
     + *deadline: Mar 6th*
     + (continues $\rightarrow$)
  6. Execution: results and write-up 
     + Present progress to class throughout the rest of the course
     + Preliminary draft due on April 28th
     + Final write-up due no later than May 8th 

     
** Roadmap: advice
- *There is little time*
- Topic choice
  + Pick a topic quickly and commit; do not overexplore
- Literature/topic presentations 
  + Do not fall into the `earlier literature' trap
  + Keep in mind whether you have access to relevant data
- You will need to allocate significant time each week. *You will not be able to 'wing it'*
- I expect you to pro-actively seek feedback and advice
  + The best projects so far have been done by groups that sought consistent feedback
  
** What constitutes a reasonable project

1. Extension of existing literature

  + Applies same methodology to different (preferably *interesting*) context

  + Different methodology to same question

2. A successful replication of an advanced empirical/computational paper

3. Original ideas are welcome

  + Advice: be modest

** Evaluation

1. Evaluation criteria:

   1. Class participation (20%)
      - Ability to demonstrate understanding of literatures
      - Intake of professor / classmate feedback

   2. Final draft quality (80%)
      
** Comments on project requirements
- Needs to be a complete draft with introduction, literature review, methodology, findings and conclusion
- No requirement in terms of number of words or number of pages
  - you will get *no points* for adding boilerplate text / adjectives / adverbs
- Syllabus will be uploaded by next week
    
  

* Topics

** Interest rate trends in developed markets
#+CAPTION: Nominal interest rates in developed markets, 1950s--present
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.85\textwidth
[[file:figures/real_interest_rates_dm.pdf]]

- Rose gradually from early 1950s, peaked in early-to-mid 1980s
- Declining trend since then to historically low levels by 2010s
- Data sources: FRED (10-Year Real Interest Rate), World Bank, Chicago Fed
  
** Are we in still in a secular stagnation world?  
- Post-GFC world characterized by: low inflation, low growth, low interest rates
- Academics believed structural / secular shift  drove interest rates down
  + Population growth / demographic shifts
    - [cite//b:@eggertssonSecularStagnationOpen2016] 
  + Financial frictions
    - [cite//b:@caballeroEquilibriumModelGlobal2008] 
      
- Question: are we going back to 2010-2020 equilibrium, or are rates 'higher for longer'?
  + [cite//b:@holstonMeasuringNaturalRate2017] 

** What are the limits to DMs fiscal capacity?  
- Large, wartime-like fiscal expansion after 2020 pandemic
  + subsequent inflation + contractionary monetary policy 
  + decline in value of government bond stock $\Rightarrow$ loss to bondholders
- Questions:
  1. What is the connection between the size of fiscal expansion and current level of rates?
  2. How much additional fiscal capacity does `dollar dominance' impart into US government?
  3. How much gov't deficit countercyclicality was / is priced into government yield curves?

** The (macro-)economic impact of AI
- Quantifying AI: labor market impacts
  + Source of massive white-collar unemployment?
  + Large productivity gains?
  + References:
    - [cite//b:@acemogluSimpleMacroeconomicsAI2025] 
    - [cite//b:@eloundouGPTsAreGPTs2024] 
      
- AI and asset prices
  + `Magnificent seven' explained bulk of stock market returns in the US over last few years
  + How much do public and private valuations reflect reasonable fundamentals?
  + Can such elevated asset prices be justified in general equlibrium?
    + [cite//b:@caballeroSpeculativeGrowthAI2025] 
      

* Resources
** Literature
- Google scholar is your friend
- If not doing so already, subscribe to NBER working paper series
  - A number papers that end up being published in the best journals first show up in NBER
  - Good for understanding what are hot topics
  - You can filter by topics of interest
  
** Data
- For macroeconomic data, the St. Louis Fed FRED has plenty of relevant data
  + API accessible, so AI friendly
- NYU libraries offer many datasets
  + Most relevant for financial markets is WRDS
- Academic papers often have 'replication packages'
  + Often buried on journal pages and hard to find 
  + Sometimes these things don't get picked up by google
  
** AI
- Some words on AI usage
  + Cursor, claude code, chatbots, workflow managers - all fair game for coding / data manipulation / bouncing ideas
  + I expect writeups to be almost entirely your work
    + I don't mind use of AI tools for minor style adjustments / checks
  + Last class will be a presentation of the final project -- AI cannot present your work for you!
